    <p id="title">Do your part to conserve critical minerals!</p>
   

    <p class = "subTitle" id="Why"> Why is conservation of critical minerals so important? </p>
    <p class = "text" id="reasonWhy"> Critical minerals are essential in many global industries and inventions, such as computers. They are also utilized in clean energy technologies to counteract fossil-fuel based counterparts. The limited quantities of these minerals and their integrity to modern life mean that they should be conserved through recycling processes so they can be re-used!
    </p>

    <p class= "subTitle"> Why recycling centers? </p>
    <p class="text">Recycling centers will make the process of redirecting used minerals to be re-utilized a viable option. This will help bridge the gap between supply and demand of critical minerals that has been expanding due to the growing pre-eminence of industries that rely on such minerals (ex. electric vehicles, computer hardware).</p>
